# DLL2SO Toolkit - Vector OS 🚀

## Overview 🌐

The **DLL2SO Toolkit** is a powerful utility designed to convert `.DLL` (Dynamic Link Library) files into `.SO` (Shared Object) files, specifically optimized for use with **Vector OS**. This tool simplifies the conversion process for Linux users, making it easier to work with DLL files in a Linux environment. 

With just a few commands, you can effortlessly convert your DLLs to SOs and integrate them into your Linux-based projects. 

## Requirements 🛠️

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** (for running the application)
- **Mono** (for .NET compatibility)
- **Wine** (optional, for running Windows-based DLLs)

## Installation ⚙️

Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VectorOS/DLL2SO-Toolkit-Vector-OS.git
   cd DLL2SO-Toolkit-Vector-OS
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**  
   Make the `setup.sh` script executable and run it to install all the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh

   This script will install the required packages and tools to ensure everything runs smoothly.

3. **Launch the Application**  
   After the setup is complete, run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

   The tool will now be ready to use! 🚀

## Usage 🖥️

Once the application is running, you can easily convert `.DLL` files to `.SO` format. Here's how it works:

1. **Drag and Drop** your DLL files into the tool.
2. The conversion process will automatically begin! 🎉

The converted `.SO` files will be ready for use in your Vector OS projects!
